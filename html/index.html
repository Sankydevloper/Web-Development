  <h1>WEB DEVLOPEMENT COURSE</h1>
  <P STYLE="background-color:blue;">Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.</P>
  <h2>FRONTEND WEB DEVLOPEMENT</h2>
  HyperText Markup Language
  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3C recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution. The CSS can be added externally, internally, or embedded in the HTML tags.[6]
  JavaScript
  JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.
  
  Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.
  WebAssembly
  WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support). Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in all browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers supported that way. Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use languages such as Rust, C or C++ or in theory any language, that compile to it.

  Goals for development
  The developer of the front end keeps these points in mind, utilizing available tools and techniques to reach this end.[5]
  Accessibility
  With continuing development for mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, designers need to ensure that their sites comes up correctly in browsers in all devices.
  <h2>BACKEND WEB DEVLOPEMENT</h2>
  <P>1. PHP  
    PHP, an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language and is one of the most widely used programming languages for backend web development. We can validate this statement by letting you know that platforms like Wikipedia, WordPress, Facebook, and many others are relying on PHP. This particular language is preferred for web development because of various prominent reasons such as cross-platform compatibility, OOPs features, easy integration with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc, huge community support, better flexibility & security, and many more. In addition, the language is quite easy to learn and use. Furthermore, there are various renowned PHP frameworks out there such as Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, etc. that you can consider.
    
    2. Python

     <p> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[36]

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>
